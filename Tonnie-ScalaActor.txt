Pong : Extends Actor
Ping : Extends Actor
	Actor is a triat (not a class or interface)
	Actor extends AbstractActor traits which itself an outputchannel.
	Actor has :mailbox (which is instance of MessageQueue)
		MessageQueue can handle MessageQueueElement
			MesageQueueElement is a node (an element called :msg, and pointer to next element called :next)
		MessaageQueue element has just two nodes of MessageQueueElement (:firt, :last)
			So it can travel from first to last and viceversa.
	Actor has a channel :rc.
		using that channel others can send/receive messages.
		Channel has following methods.
			forward(msg, anotherchannel), send(msg), receive, receiveWithin
	Actor can be started using it's start method (which is synchronized)
	
	Actor uses Scheduler to execute itself.
		Scheduler is Fork/JoinTaskScheduler.
		Scheduler can accept runnable, or any function which returns Unit or ()
		
	Actor's start method ensures that Actor is pushed to underneath sceduler for execution.
	
	Actor has two attibutes, :receiver (==this), and :sender (still trying to find how they implmented sender without ThreadLocal)

When Actor is executed from main(String...), main thread completes sooner before Actor completes.

Prefered way of creating Actor is using it's Singleton method, it's behaviour is defined insdie act() method.
